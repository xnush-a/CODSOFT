# CODSOFT
For my virtual internship at CodSoft in C++ Programming, I have completed 3 tasks:
1. I created a calculator to perform basic arithmetic calculations(i.e. +,-,* and /).
2. Created a 'Random Number Generating Game' which generates a random number from 1 to 10 and asks the user to guess the number (giving the user several attempts) .After the user correctly guessing the number,it prints the number (that was to be guessed by the user ) and the total number of guesses the user used.
3. Created a 'Student Grading System' that inputs the total number of students and then the name and corresponding grades of each student and outputs the 'Average Grade' of the students.
